Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist (i.e.,Drive-by Target), including:A legitimate website is compromised, allowing adversaries to inject malicious codeScript files served to a legitimate website from a publicly writeable cloud storage bucket are modified by an adversaryMalicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers (i.e.,Malvertising)Built-in web application interfaces that allow user-controllable content are leveraged for the insertion of malicious scripts or iFrames (e.g., cross-site scripting)Browser push notifications may also be abused by adversaries and leveraged for malicious code injection viaUser Execution. By clicking \"allow\" on browser push notifications, users may be granting a website permission to run JavaScript code on their browser.[1][2][3]Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or a particular region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring.[4]Typical drive-by compromise process:A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting, notifications, or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.If exploitation is successful, the adversary will gain code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place. In some cases, a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.UnlikeExploit Public-Facing Application, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.",

Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveragingUser Execution. The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place.Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly. Additionally, adversaries may use seemingly benign links that abuse special characters to mimic legitimate websites (known as an \"IDN homograph attack\").[1]URLs may also be obfuscated by taking advantage of quirks in the URL schema, such as the acceptance of integer- or hexadecimal-based hostname formats and the automatic discarding of text before an \"@\" symbol: for example,hxxp://google.com@1157586937.[2]Adversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing, typically with OAuth 2.0 request URLs that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications, allowing adversaries toSteal Application Access Tokens.[3]These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls.[4]Adversaries may also utilize spearphishing links toSteal Application Access Tokens that grant immediate access to the victim environment. For example, a user may be lured through \"consent phishing\" into granting adversaries permissions/access via a malicious OAuth 2.0 request URL .[3][4]Similarly, malicious links may also target device-based authorization, such as OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow which is typically used to authenticate devices without UIs/browsers. Known as \"device code phishing,\" an adversary may send a link that directs the victim to a malicious authorization page where the user is tricked into entering a code/credentials that produces a device token.[5][6][7]",

Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.A common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting.

Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS, the root user account in ESXi, and the default service account in Kubernetes.[1][2][3]Default accounts are not limited to client machines; rather, they also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications, whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolenPrivate Keysor credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments viaRemote Services.[4]Default accounts may be created on a system after initial setup by connecting or integrating it with another application. For example, when an ESXi server is connected to a vCenter server, a default privileged account calledvpxuseris created on the ESXi server. If a threat actor is able to compromise this account’s credentials (for example, viaExploitation for Credential Accesson the vCenter host), they will then have access to the ESXi server.[5][6]",

These frameworks typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.[11][12][13][14]Adversaries may use assembly to directly or in-directly invoke syscalls in an attempt to subvert defensive sensors and detection signatures such as user mode API-hooks.[15]Adversaries may also attempt to tamper with sensors and defensive tools associated with API monitoring, such as unhooking monitored functions viaDisable or Modify Tools.",

Since the kernel is responsible for enforcing security and the kernel extensions run as apart of the kernel, kexts are not governed by macOS security policies. Kexts are loaded and unloaded throughkextloadandkextunloadcommands. Kexts need to be signed with a developer ID that is granted privileges by Apple allowing it to sign Kernel extensions. Developers without these privileges may still sign kexts but they will not load unless SIP is disabled. If SIP is enabled, the kext signature is verified before being added to the AuxKC.[4]Since macOS Catalina 10.15, kernel extensions have been deprecated in favor of System Extensions. However, kexts are still allowed as \"Legacy System Extensions\" since there is no System Extension for Kernel Programming Interfaces.[5]Adversaries can use LKMs and kexts to conductPersistenceand/orPrivilege Escalationon a system. Examples have been found in the wild, and there are some relevant open source projects as well.[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]",

    "description": "Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. UserUnix Shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the/etc/profileand/etc/profile.dfiles.[1][2]These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches. For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into~/.bash_profile,~/.bash_login, or~/.profilewhich are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely.[3][4]Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used~/.bash_profileto ensure execution.

When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell. The login shell configures the system environment using/etc/profile,/etc/zshenv,/etc/zprofile, and/etc/zlogin.[8][9][10][11]The login shell then configures the user environment with~/.zprofileand~/.zlogin.

Extensions generally inherit the web browser's permissions previously granted.[1][2]Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores, so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.[3]Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary-controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions.Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using theprofilestool to install malicious.mobileconfigfiles. In macOS 11+, the use of theprofilestool can no longer install configuration profiles; however,.mobileconfigfiles can be planted and installed with user interaction.[4]Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.[5][6][7][8]There have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions forCommand and Control.[9][10]Adversaries may also use browser extensions to modify browser permissions and components, privacy settings, and other security controls forDefense Evasion.[11][12]",

    "description": "Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e.Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r[1], is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enableNetwork Device Authenticationfor standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.[2][3][4]To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leveragePatch System Imagedue to the monolithic nature of the architecture.Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it. Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement.[5][6]",

    "description": "An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively.[1]Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications (i.e.Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification). Thechmodcommand can set these bits with bitmasking,chmod 4777 [file]or via shorthand naming,chmod u+s [file]. This will enable the setuid bit. To enable the setgid bit,chmod 2775andchmod g+scan be used.Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.[2]This abuse is often part of a \"shell escape\" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions.Alternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled (i.e.File and Directory Discovery). The setuid and setguid bits are indicated with an \"s\" instead of an \"x\" when viewing a file's attributes vials -l. Thefindcommand can also be used to search for such files. For example,find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/nullcan be used to find files with setuid set andfind / -perm +2000 2>/dev/nullmay be used for setgid. Binaries that have these bits set may then be abused by adversaries.[3]",

    "description": "Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as \"superuser do\") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. Thesudocommand \"allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.\"[1]Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as atimestamp_timeout, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances ofsudobefore it will re-prompt for a password. This is becausesudohas the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at/var/db/sudowith a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is atty_ticketsvariable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).The sudoers file,/etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line likeuser1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.[2]Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For example,/var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within thetimestamp_timeoutrange. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. Additional, iftty_ticketsis disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.In the wild, malware has disabledtty_ticketsto potentially make scripting easier by issuingecho \\'Defaults !tty_tickets\\' >> /etc/sudoers.[3]In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issuedkillall Terminal.

TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA).When an application requests to access data or a service protected by TCC, the TCC daemon (tccd) checks the TCC database, located at/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db(and~/equivalent), and an overwrites file (if connected to an MDM) for existing permissions. If permissions do not exist, then the user is prompted to grant permission. Once permissions are granted, the database stores the application's permissions and will not prompt the user again unless reset. For example, when a web browser requests permissions to the user's webcam, once granted the web browser may not explicitly prompt the user again.[1]Adversaries may access restricted data or services protected by TCC through abusing applications previously granted permissions throughProcess Injectionor executing a malicious binary using another application. For example, adversaries can use Finder, a macOS native app with FDA permissions, to execute a maliciousAppleScript. When executing under the Finder App, the maliciousAppleScriptinherits access to all files on the system without requiring a user prompt. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) is disabled, TCC protections are also disabled. For a system without SIP enabled, adversaries can manipulate the TCC database to add permissions to their malicious executable through loading an adversary controlled TCC database using environment variables andLaunchctl.[2][3]",

Since the kernel is responsible for enforcing security and the kernel extensions run as apart of the kernel, kexts are not governed by macOS security policies.

UserUnix Shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the/etc/profileand/etc/profile.dfiles.[1][2]These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches. For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into~/.bash_profile,~/.bash_login, or~/.profilewhich are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely.[3][4]Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used~/.bash_profileto ensure execution. Adversaries have also leveraged the~/.bashrcfile which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line interface.[5][3][6][7]Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use the~/.bash_logoutfile to execute malicious commands at the end of a session.For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+. When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell. The login shell configures the system environment using/etc/profile,/etc/zshenv,/etc/zprofile, and/etc/zlogin.[8][9][10][11]The login shell then configures the user environment with~/.zprofileand~/.zlogin.

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode.

Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific.More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.",

Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as \"superuser do\") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. Thesudocommand \"allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.\"[1]Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as atimestamp_timeout, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances ofsudobefore it will re-prompt for a password. This is becausesudohas the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at/var/db/sudowith a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is atty_ticketsvariable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).The sudoers file,/etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line likeuser1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.[2]Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For example,/var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within thetimestamp_timeoutrange. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password.

If permissions do not exist, then the user is prompted to grant permission. Once permissions are granted, the database stores the application's permissions and will not prompt the user again unless reset. For example, when a web browser requests permissions to the user's webcam, once granted the web browser may not explicitly prompt the user again.[1]Adversaries may access restricted data or services protected by TCC through abusing applications previously granted permissions throughProcess Injectionor executing a malicious binary using another application. For example, adversaries can use Finder, a macOS native app with FDA permissions, to execute a maliciousAppleScript.

Similar toVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion, if the adversary detects a debugger, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for debugger artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary. On Windows, this may involveNative APIfunction calls such asIsDebuggerPresent()andNtQueryInformationProcess(), or manually checking theBeingDebuggedflag of the Process Environment Block (PEB). On Linux, this may involve querying/proc/self/statusfor theTracerPIDfield, which indicates whether or not the process is being traced by dynamic analysis tools.[2][3]Other checks for debugging artifacts may also seek to enumerate hardware breakpoints, interrupt assembly opcodes, time checks, or measurements if exceptions are raised in the current process (assuming a present debugger would \"swallow\" or handle the potential error).[4][5][6]Malware may also leverage Structured Exception Handling (SEH) to detect debuggers by throwing an exception and detecting whether the process is suspended. SEH handles both hardware and software expectations, providing control over the exceptions including support for debugging. If a debugger is present, the program’s control will be transferred to the debugger, and the execution of the code will be suspended. If the debugger is not present, control will be transferred to the SEH handler, which will automatically handle the exception and allow the program’s execution to continue.[7]Adversaries may use the information learned from these debugger checks during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. Debuggers can also be evaded by detaching the process or flooding debug logs with meaningless data via messages produced by loopingNative APIfunction calls such asOutputDebugStringW().[8][9]",

Email clients display these headers when emails appear in a victim's inbox, which may cause modified emails to appear as if they were from the spoofed entity.This behavior may succeed when the spoofed entity either does not enable or enforce identity authentication tools such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and/or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC).[2][3][4]Even if SPF and DKIM are configured properly, spoofing may still succeed when a domain sets a weak DMARC policy such asv=DMARC1; p=none; fo=1;. This means that while DMARC is technically present, email servers are not instructed to take any filtering action when emails fail authentication checks.[1][5]Adversaries may abuse absent or weakly configured SPF, SKIM, and/or DMARC policies to conceal social engineering attempts[5]such asPhishing.

Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses.[2][3][4][5][6]By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult.[2][6]These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).Similar toObfuscated Files or Information, adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection. Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.[2][4][5][6][7]By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection.

To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (dir /afor Windows andls –afor Linux and macOS).On Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a \".\" as the first character in the file or folder name[1][2]. Files and folders that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like \"ls\". Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.Files on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app[3]. On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.",

Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as theNew-InboxRuleorSet-InboxRulePowerShellcmdlets on Windows systems.[1][2][3][4]Adversaries may utilize email rules within a compromised user's mailbox to delete and/or move emails to less noticeable folders. Adversaries may do this to hide security alerts, C2 communication, or responses toInternal Spearphishingemails sent from the compromised account.Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) may be able to create rules to automatically move or delete emails. These rules can be abused to impair/delay detection had the email content been immediately seen by a user or defender. Malicious rules commonly filter out emails based on key words (such asmalware,suspicious,phish, andhack) found in message bodies and subject lines.[5]In some environments, administrators may be able to enable email rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.[6]Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to automatically modify or delete all emails related to specific topics (such as internal security incident notifications).",

This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products.In Linux environments, adversaries may disable or reconfigure log processing tools such as syslog or nxlog to inhibit detection and monitoring capabilities to facilitate follow on behaviors.[5]ESXi also leverages syslog, which can be reconfigured via commands such asesxcli system syslog config setandesxcli system syslog config reload.[6][7]",

These campaigns are often specifically targeted against people who, due to job roles and/or accesses, can carry out the adversary’s goal.Impersonation is typically preceded by reconnaissance techniques such asGather Victim Identity InformationandGather Victim Org Informationas well as acquiring infrastructure such as email domains (i.e.Domains) to substantiate their false identity.[1]There is the potential for multiple victims in campaigns involving impersonation.

A common use of this technique is withSpearphishing Attachment/Malicious Filesince it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character. Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.[2][3]RTLO can be used in the Windows Registry as well, where regedit.exe displays the reversed characters but the command line tool reg.exe does not by default.",

Based on this, adversaries may use a file extension to disguise malware, such as naming a PHP backdoor code with a file name oftest.gif. A user may not know that a file is malicious due to the benign appearance and file extension.Polygot files, which are files that have multiple different file types and that function differently based on the application that will execute them, may also be used to disguise malicious malware and capabilities.[1]",

For example, adversaries can execute their payload without any arguments, call thefork()API call twice, then have the parent process exit. This creates a grandchild process with no parent process that is immediately adopted by theinitsystem process (PID 1), which successfully disconnects the execution of the adversary's payload from its previous process tree.Another example is using the \"daemon\" syscall to detach from the current parent process and run in the background.[2][3]",

Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as layer of Apple’s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host. Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009) and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more. Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.[1][2]Based on an opt-in system, when files are downloaded an extended attribute (xattr) calledcom.apple.quarantine(also known as a quarantine flag) can be set on the file by the application performing the download. Launch Services opens the application in a suspended state. For first run applications with the quarantine flag set, Gatekeeper executes the following functions:Checks extended attribute – Gatekeeper checks for the quarantine flag, then provides an alert prompt to the user to allow or deny execution.[3][4]Checks System Policies - Gatekeeper checks the system security policy, allowing execution of apps downloaded from either just the App Store or the App Store and identified developers.Code Signing – Gatekeeper checks for a valid code signature from an Apple Developer ID.Notarization - Using theapi.apple-cloudkit.comAPI, Gatekeeper reaches out to Apple servers to verify or pull down the notarization ticket and ensure the ticket is not revoked. Users can override notarization, which will result in a prompt of executing an \"unauthorized app\" and the security policy will be modified.Adversaries can subvert one or multiple security controls within Gatekeeper checks through logic errors (e.g.Exploitation for Defense Evasion), unchecked file types, and external libraries. For example, prior to macOS 13 Ventura, code signing and notarization checks were only conducted on first launch, allowing adversaries to write malicious executables to previously opened applications in order to bypass Gatekeeper security checks.[5][6]Applications and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command may not set the quarantine flag. Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting the quarantine flag usingDrive-by Compromise.",

Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate.[1]Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system. Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.[2]Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provideAdversary-in-the-Middlecapability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications.[3]Root certificates (and their associated chains) can also be cloned and reinstalled. Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools (ex: Sysinternals, antivirus, etc.) used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence.[4]In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses/usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/certto install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain.[5]",

Since it can be useful for developers to modify default signature enforcement policies during the development and testing of applications, disabling of these features may be possible with elevated permissions.[3][2]Adversaries may modify code signing policies in a number of ways, including through use of command-line or GUI utilities,Modify Registry, rebooting the computer in a debug/recovery mode, or by altering the value of variables in kernel memory.[4][2][5][6]Examples of commands that can modify the code signing policy of a system includebcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ONon Windows andcsrutil disableon macOS.[4][2]Depending on the implementation, successful modification of a signing policy may require reboot of the compromised system.

Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e.Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r[1], is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enableNetwork Device Authenticationfor standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.[2][3][4]To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leveragePatch System Imagedue to the monolithic nature of the architecture.Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it.

Other methods may rely on specific user interaction with the system before the malicious code is activated, such as waiting for a document to close before activating a macro[3]or waiting for a user to double click on an embedded image to activate.[4]",

Delays may also be based on waiting for specific victim conditions to be met (ex: system time, events, etc.) or employ scheduledMulti-Stage Channelsto avoid analysis and scrutiny.[1]Benign commands or other operations may also be used to delay malware execution. Loops or otherwise needless repetitions of commands, such asPings, may be used to delay malware execution and potentially exceed time thresholds of automated analysis environments.[2][3]Another variation, commonly referred to as API hammering, involves making various calls toNative APIfunctions in order to delay execution (while also potentially overloading analysis environments with junk data).[4][5]Adversaries may also use time as a metric to detect sandboxes and analysis environments, particularly those that attempt to manipulate time mechanisms to simulate longer elapses of time.

If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.[2][3]Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic.

    "description": "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.Credentialing and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to gain authenticated access to systems. One example of this isMS14-068, which targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions.[1][2]Another example of this is replay attacks, in which the adversary intercepts data packets sent between parties and then later replays these packets. If services don't properly validate authentication requests, these replayed packets may allow an adversary to impersonate one of the parties and gain unauthorized access or privileges.[3][4][5]Such exploitation has been demonstrated in cloud environments as well. For example, adversaries have exploited vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure that allowed for unintended authentication token creation and renewal.[6]Exploitation for credential access may also result in Privilege Escalation depending on the process targeted or credentials obtained.",

With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token.[1]Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes).[2]Other methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception.

In Kerberos environments, referred to as \"realms\", there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC).[1]Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated. The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.  Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.On Windows, the built-inklistutility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.[2]",

Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyze the execution of potential malware payloads.[1]Debugger evasion may include changing behaviors based on the results of the checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a debugged environment. Similar toVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion, if the adversary detects a debugger, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for debugger artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary. On Windows, this may involveNative APIfunction calls such asIsDebuggerPresent()andNtQueryInformationProcess(), or manually checking theBeingDebuggedflag of the Process Environment Block (PEB). On Linux, this may involve querying/proc/self/statusfor theTracerPIDfield, which indicates whether or not the process is being traced by dynamic analysis tools.[2][3]Other checks for debugging artifacts may also seek to enumerate hardware breakpoints, interrupt assembly opcodes, time checks, or measurements if exceptions are raised in the current process (assuming a present debugger would \"swallow\" or handle the potential error).[4][5][6]Malware may also leverage Structured Exception Handling (SEH) to detect debuggers by throwing an exception and detecting whether the process is suspended. SEH handles both hardware and software expectations, providing control over the exceptions including support for debugging. If a debugger is present, the program’s control will be transferred to the debugger, and the execution of the code will be suspended. If the debugger is not present, control will be transferred to the SEH handler, which will automatically handle the exception and allow the program’s execution to continue.[7]Adversaries may use the information learned from these debugger checks during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. Debuggers can also be evaded by detaching the process or flooding debug logs with meaningless data via messages produced by loopingNative APIfunction calls such asOutputDebugStringW().[8][9]",

Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such asLLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay, can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.Network sniffing may reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequentLateral Movementand/orDefense Evasionactivities. Adversaries may likely also utilize network sniffing duringAdversary-in-the-Middle(AiTM) to passively gain additional knowledge about the environment.In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.[1][2][3]Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traffic.[4][5]The adversary can then use exfiltration techniques such as Transfer Data to Cloud Account in order to access the sniffed traffic.[4]On network devices, adversaries may perform network captures usingNetwork Device CLIcommands such asmonitor capture.[6][7]",

Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It usesShortcut Modificationof directory .LNK files that useMasqueradingto look like the real directories, which are hidden throughHidden Files and Directories. The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts.[1]Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS.",

    "description": "Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such asNetwork SniffingorTransmitted Data Manipulation.The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.[1]Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.[2][3]Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.[2]",

By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such asNetwork SniffingorTransmitted Data Manipulation.DHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.[1]The typical server-client interaction is as follows:The client broadcasts aDISCOVERmessage.The server responds with anOFFERmessage, which includes an available network address.The client broadcasts aREQUESTmessage, which includes the network address offered.The server acknowledges with anACKmessage and the client receives the network configuration parameters.Adversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.[2][3]Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.DHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending aINFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)message to theAll_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Serversmulticast address.[4]Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.Rather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e,Service Exhaustion Flood) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool.",

    "description": "Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim’s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations.[1]Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators.[2]Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.[3][4]Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more. Adversaries may also hide the rule by making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration tools.[2]In some environments, administrators may be able to enable email forwarding rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.[5]Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to enable forwarding on all or specific mail an organization receives.",

In order to increase the likelihood of capturing credentials quickly, an adversary may also perform actions such as clearing browser cookies to force users to reauthenticate to systems.[1]Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes.[2]Some methods include:Hooking API callbacks used for processing keystrokes. UnlikeCredential API Hooking, this focuses solely on API functions intended for processing keystroke data.Reading raw keystroke data from the hardware buffer.Windows Registry modifications.Custom drivers.Modify System Imagemay provide adversaries with hooks into the operating system of network devices to read raw keystrokes for login sessions.[3]",

For example, an adversary may use a virtual private cloud to spoof their IP address to closer align with a victim's IP address ranges.

This traffic is similar to client-server communications on traditional network sockets but is localized to the physical machine running the ESXi host, meaning it does not traverse external networks (routers, switches). This results in communications that are invisible to external monitoring and standard networking tools like tcpdump, netstat, nmap, and Wireshark.

A variation of the the technique, \"domainless\" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header. Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y.",

Unlike SSH and port forwarding, IDE tunneling encapsulates an entire session and may use proprietary tunneling protocols alongside SSH, allowing adversaries to blend in with legitimate development workflows. Some IDEs, like Visual Studio Code, also provide CLI tools (e.g.,code tunnel) that adversaries may use to programmatically establish tunnels and generate web-accessible URLs for remote access. These tunnels can be authenticated through accounts such as GitHub, enabling the adversary to control the compromised system via a legitimate developer portal.[1][2][3]Additionally, adversaries may use IDE tunneling for persistence. Some IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code and JetBrains, support automatic reconnection. Adversaries may configure the IDE to auto-launch at startup, re-establishing the tunnel upon execution.

    "description": "Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e.Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r[1], is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enableNetwork Device Authenticationfor standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.[2][3][4]To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leveragePatch System Imagedue to the monolithic nature of the architecture.Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it. Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement.[5][6]",

    "description": "Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes[1]and to support other malicious activities, including distraction[2], hacktivism, and extortion.[3]An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.[4]In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.[5]For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, seeNetwork Denial of Service.",

    "description": "Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (OS). A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.[1]With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.[2]ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.[3]",

Adversaries often target the availability of DNS and web services, however others have been targeted as well.[1]Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it. This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.[2]Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests. Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.[3]",

    "description": "Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.Direct Network Floods are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network. Almost any network protocol may be used for flooding. Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.Botnets are commonly used to conduct network flooding attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global Internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for distributed DoS (DDoS), so many systems are used to generate the flood that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to saturate the target network. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS flooding attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.[1]",

    "name": "Reflection Amplification",
    "description": "Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target.[1]This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack. Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers. The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume. Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS[2]and NTP[3], though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.[4]In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.[5]",
